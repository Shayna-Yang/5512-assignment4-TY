1. Project Overview
-------------------
This dataset was created as part of an analysis exploring whether the Big Mac Index accurately reflects real cost-of-living changes in Taiwan. The project includes a comparative approach using data from both Taiwan and Australia, aligning Big Mac prices, CPI indexes, and exchange rates across consistent time points.

The data sources are all publicly available and include government statistics and economic indicators. All personal identifiers were excluded, and only aggregated, country-level data were used.

2. Files Included
-----------------

1. bigmac_2015-2025.csv  
   → Taiwan: Big Mac price, implied exchange rate, official exchange rate (NTD/USD), and Consumer Price Index (CPI).

2. bigmac_cpi_2015-2025.csv  
   → Combined dataset including Taiwan and Australia: Big Mac price and CPI index for both countries.

3. data-dictionary.csv  
   → A data dictionary explaining all variables across both datasets, including definitions, transformations, and derivations.

4. README.txt  
   → This file. Provides context for understanding, interpreting, and ethically using the dataset.

3. How to Use the Data
----------------------

- Load into R using:
```r
read_csv("data/bigmac_2015-2025.csv")
read_csv("data/bigmac_cpi_2015-2025.csv")
Use data-dictionary.csv to understand variable definitions, units, and processing history.

This dataset is suitable for:

- Assessing currency misalignment via Big Mac PPP vs. actual exchange rates.

- Comparing Big Mac pricing trends with inflation indicators (CPI).

- Performing cross-country cost-of-living analysis (Taiwan vs. Australia).

Assumptions and Processing Notes

- Big Mac Index data is released biannually (January and July). All CPI and exchange rate data were aligned accordingly by shifting values from December/June to January/July.

- Australian CPI data, originally in % annual change, was converted into index form (base = 100) for visual comparability.

- Taiwan’s CPI index and exchange rates were retrieved from official government sources and adjusted for temporal alignment.

- All data cleaning, joining, and visualizations were performed using R packages.

Limitations

- The Big Mac Index only reflects a single consumer good and may not capture full inflationary trends.

- The Australian CPI index is reconstructed from annual % change data and may not reflect full granularity.

- Regional price variation within each country is not considered.

- Currency undervaluation/overvaluation estimates are based on a simplified PPP model and do not consider trade policies or capital flows.

Ethics and Responsible Use

- All data are aggregated and publicly available.

- This dataset should be used strictly for academic and educational purposes (ETC5512 Assignment 4).

- No attempt should be made to draw individual or company-level conclusions.

- Data sources are appropriately cited and fall under open data licenses (OGDL, CC BY 4.0).
